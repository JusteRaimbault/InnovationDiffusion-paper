\section{Introduction}

Following \cite{hagerstrand1968innovation}, the evolutionary urban theory proposed by \cite{pumain2018evolutionary} considers innovation waves between cities as a crucial components of their interactions. \cite{favaro2011gibrat} integrate this view into a model of growth for a system of cities. \cite{finance2016villes} studies investment linkages between firms to characterize networks of cities.

Empirical quantifications at a large scale and on long time scales are however rare in the literature. \cite{grubler1996time} shows on examples a typical logistic curve of adoption rate in time. \cite{albuquerque2007spatiotemporal} investigate the diffusion of two norms across countries.

\cite{acs2002patents} uses patents to study regional productivity.

We propose to study the diffusion of innovation in urban systems through the lens of exhaustive patent data, combining different layers of complete patents networks.

This contribution is new on the following points: (i) we are to the best of our knowledge the first to use exhaustive patents data sets; (ii) we take an urban system perspective, more precisely in the context of the evolutionary urban theory; (iii) we study complementary dimensions of innovation, namely citation and semantic relations between patents.

\section{Project}

\subsection{Objective}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Existence of spatio-temporal patterns in the different layers of patents network ?
    \item At which temporal and spatial scale ?
	\item Patterns depending of types of techno ?
	\item In this case, relation of these patterns to the dynamics of the urban system ?
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Protocol}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Formalize the theoretical framework and assumptions to be tested
	\item Consolidate databases
	\item Exploratory analysis
	\item Targeted analysis (specific questions): modeling ?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Details}


\subsection{Datasets}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item USPTO
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Raw data \url{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BW3ACK}
        \item Citation
        \item Semantic classification 1976-2012 \cite{bergeaud2017classifying}, dataset at \url{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZULMOY}
        \item localisation of inventors / or establishments (more accurate ?) \cite{li2014disambiguation}
    \end{itemize}
	\item European patent data 
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item clean database with localisation ?
        \item \textit{semantic processing to be done}
     \end{itemize}
	\item Cities database (spatial granularity: long time ontology for cities - evolving boundaries \cite{bretagnolle2009villes}) : ERC Geodivercity
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Quantifying diffusion processes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Temporal mapping \cite{hagerstrand1968innovation}
	\item Spatio-temporal econometrics
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Simple ARMA models 
        \item Spatio-temporal econometrics (including GWR \cite{brunsdon1998geographically}) \cite{lichstein2002spatial}
        \item Datamining on lagged correlations \cite{raimbault2017identification}
        \item Instrumental variables ?
    \end{itemize}
	\item Diffusion models
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item epidemiology : spatial SIR and extensions \cite{keeling1999effects} \cite{fuentes1999cellular}
    	\item networks \cite{valente2005network} \cite{Zhang2018} (example with evolving network \cite{gross2006epidemic})
        \item ecology \cite{sonis1983spatio}
        \item reaction-diffusion models (see e.g. \cite{raimbault2018calibration} for a model of urban growth)
        \item agent-based models of spatial diffusion \cite{le2018aggregate}
        \item Bayesian models in the diffusion of language \cite{bouckaert2012mapping}
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Specificities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item we have at least three layers/dimensions on which diffusion can be studied : citation, semantic and technological
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Citation network : citation flows between cities can directly be interpreted as innovation diffusion
        \item Semantic network : flows of keywords in time between cities ? (spatialized alluvial diagram)
        \item Technological network : idem can define flows with overlap between classes
    \end{itemize}
	\item we have ontologically consistent urban entities between which the interactions must be estimated
\end{itemize}
